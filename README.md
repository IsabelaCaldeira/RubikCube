# Rubik Cube Solver :bulb:	
Here is being made an algorithm to solve the rubik cube!

The rubik cube is a toy for kids and also a passion of the mathematicians. It is very complex and there are A LOT of possibilities when is about solving one.

(When I say a lot is I mean 43,252,003,274,489,856,000 possible combinations.)

Now, I think you can understand why I was always facinaded by it and solving it myself and now I doing something that I always wanted to do that is to put it on code and solve it virtuality!

Here is the result of me trying to play with code and my other hobbies. 

Hope you enjoy it and that it may help you out :)
