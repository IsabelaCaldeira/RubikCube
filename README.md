# Rubik Cube Solver :bulb:	
Here is being made an algorithm to solve the rubik cube!

The rubik cube is a toy for kids and also a passion of the mathematicians, it is very complex and full of possibilities when is about solving one. 

I was always facinaded by solving it myself, so I decided to put it on code and solve it virtuality now!

Here is the result of me trying to play with code and my other hobbies. 

Hope you enjoy it and that it may help you out :)
